## About this code  
This Geant4 code is performed with **Multi-Thread mode**, and The primary particle sources are readed from **Phase shace file**.  
The geometry is considered of Linac_NovalisTx_Geant4.git.  
 

### Geometry  
1) World  
2) Phantom designed by 3D-CAD (*.stl -> *.ply)  
2) Scorer (in middle of phantom, EPID position)  

### Source   
1) Phase space file (filename: Phsp_FieldType3_v2.0_num1.txt)   

### Scoring    
1) Detector (Voxel geometry 1000 x 1000)
